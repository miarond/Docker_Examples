# A Basic Container For Using Ansible

This container is based on the [Alpine Linux image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine) and contains the basic software needed to run Ansible and automate various Cisco products, such as DNA Center and Intersight.  The Dockerfile can be edited to add additional dependencies and Collections from Ansible Galaxy, as needed.
